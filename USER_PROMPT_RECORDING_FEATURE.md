# User Prompt Recording - Feature Update

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

The PromptQuest training app has been enhanced to record and display the user's original prompts in their progress history. This improvement helps users remember what they wrote and review their previous attempts more effectively.

## âœ¨ What's New

### 1. **Original Prompt Storage**
- Every submitted prompt is now stored alongside the evaluation results
- Prompts are preserved in the JSON data file and CSV exports
- Backward compatibility maintained for existing data

### 2. **Enhanced Progress History**
- Progress history now displays the user's original prompt text
- Prompts are shown in a code block for easy reading
- Clear indication when prompt data is not available (for older entries)

### 3. **Improved CSV Export**
- New `user_prompt` column in CSV exports
- Full prompt text included for analysis and review
- Updated export documentation

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Details

### Data Structure Changes
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-09-30T13:54:22.932030",
  "scenario_id": "b1", 
  "score": 85,
  "evaluation": {...},
  "user_prompt": "User's original prompt text here"  // NEW FIELD
}
```

### UI Improvements
- **Progress History**: Shows original prompts in expandable sections
- **Export Documentation**: Updated to mention prompt inclusion
- **Data Export**: New column for prompt analysis

### Backward Compatibility
- Existing data without prompts shows as "*(Not recorded)*"
- Old entries continue to work normally
- No data migration required

## ðŸš€ Benefits

1. **Better Learning**: Users can review what they wrote alongside feedback
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Compare successful prompts across attempts  
3. **Data Analysis**: Export prompts for advanced analysis
4. **Memory Aid**: Remember previous approaches and iterations

## ðŸ§ª Testing

A comprehensive test suite (`test_user_prompt_recording.py`) verifies:
- âœ… Prompt recording functionality
- âœ… CSV export with prompts
- âœ… Backward compatibility
- âœ… Data integrity

## ðŸ“Š Usage

### For Users
1. **Submit Prompts**: Continue using the app normally
2. **View History**: Check "Progress History" to see your original prompts
3. **Export Data**: CSV exports now include your prompt text

### For Administrators  
- No setup required - feature works automatically
- CSV exports include additional `user_prompt` column
- Existing data remains fully functional

## ðŸ”® Future Enhancements

Potential improvements based on this foundation:
- Prompt similarity analysis
- Best prompt recommendations  
- Prompt version comparison
- Advanced prompt analytics dashboard
