Without this, the AI cannot complete the core task. This could be done by appending the outline directly to the prompt or clearly stating where it will be provided (e.g., 'The outline will follow this prompt in a separate message').; Specify Text Formatting: 'Necessary text formatting' is vague. Provide examples or specific requirements (e.g., 'Use clear headings for sections, bold key terms, ensure font size is readable for a presentation').; Clarify 'Major Section': While generally understood, for complex outlines, it might be helpful to define what constitutes a 'major section' from the user's perspective (e.g., 'Each top-level heading in my outline should be a major section').; Guidance on Graphics: While the condition is good, 'emphasis on the subject matter' is subjective. Consider adding guidance on the *type* of graphics (e.g., 'simple icons, relevant charts, or stock photos related to the topic') or suggesting the AI ask for clarification if unsure.",The prompt clearly articulates the desired output (PowerPoint presentation) and several key formatti...
